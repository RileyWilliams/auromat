# Common rules for all tests.
#
# The tests only have to define the following variables and rules:
#
# - ROOT: the root of the source
# - PDFS: the list of Pdf files to be generated.
# - For each of the Pdf files, a rule that generates either a .deps file or a
#   .clusters file (there is a rule that automatically generates a clusted .deps
#   from a .clusters if required).

# Define new file types.
.SUFFIXES: .log .deps .dot .pdf .clusters

# Allow including this file from anywhere.
## (only works with GNU make-3.81)
##.SECONDEXPANSION:

# Do not delete intermediate dot files from chained implicit rules.
.PRECIOUS: %.log %.deps %.dot %.clusters
