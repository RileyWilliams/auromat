Errors in unit tests using PyDev (Eclipse)
--------------------------------

The following error may occur:

[...]
  File "/home/.../.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/spacepy/pycdf/__init__.py", line 80, in <module>
    from . import const
ImportError: cannot import name const

The real error is hidden and is displayed when running code outside the unit test.
The problem is that CDF_LIB isn't defined and then subsequently the import fails.

Solution: Put the following line into ~/.profile:
export CDF_LIB=/path/to/cdf/lib
